"""
File to create test time augmentation functions to transform images in order to be applied to be processed by an object detection method.

The idea is to return a function to transform the images and a function to transform each object detected to the original position so we can get the detection on the original image coordinates.

All functions will assume computational point standard (height, width).

    """Function to create an image flip transformation and the function to transpose information from one image to the original.

    Args:
        axis (str): "horizontal", "vertical" or "both". Defines the axis used to flip de image so 
                    "horizontal" implies the image would be flipped left to right (top-left corner would be top-right),
                    "vertical" implies the image would be flipped top to bottom (top-left corner would be bottom-left) and horizontal both so the top-left corner would be the bottom-right.

        Function: Function that takes an image and flips it.
        Function: Function that takes information from a flipped image and transforms it to the original image position.
